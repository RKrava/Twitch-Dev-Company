# Twitch Dev Company
A Twitch game inspired by Game Dev Tycoon, and Software Inc.

## About

Twitch Dev Company is a game that viewers can play on stream through whispers.

When they first send a message/whisper, they'll be added as a developer and spawn on screen. They can join or start a company, get involved in others projects, or recruit a team for their own. During this, they'll earn virtual money to spend on upgrading their gear or customising their character.

## Planned Features

- Join or start your own company.
- Edit or leave a company.
- Start and recruit a team for your project.
- Join a project as a developer.

(And other stuff!)
