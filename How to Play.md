# How to Play

## Developer

To be added to the game as a developer, you need to have dropped a message in chat, or whispered the bot.

### Money

You cannot currently buy anything with your money. In future updates, you will be able to buy cosmetic and practical gear.

### Commands

!money - Check how much money you have.

!skills - Check your skills.

!xp - Check the amount of XP you have in each skill.

!questions - Turn random questions during development on or off. **NOTE:** Questions will give you bonuses if you get them correct, and debuffs if incorrect.

## Company

### Money

Money stored in a company is used to fund projects, such as buying features and paying developers.

### Invites

You can invite upto two other people to join your company. They will be able to do everything you can, except edit the name of the company, so only invite people you trust.

When you send an invite to someone, they will get a whisper telling them. They will then have 5 minutes to respond. If they do not respond in time, the invite will run out and you will have to send it again.

## Project

You have to be a founder of a company to start a project, and only one can run at a time.

### Starting a Project (3 mins)

When you start a project, a message will be posted in chat announcing that people can apply. This will last for a minute, and then you will receive a message with a link to a Pastebin.

This Pastebin contains a list of everyone that has applied, the skill of the position they applied for, and how much they will cost for the full development time.

During this time, you should also add features to the project. Go to the Features section below to read what features exist, their cost, and the amount of points you require to get them to Good quality. **REMEMBER:** It is more important to have few better quality features, than a ton of low quality features.

### Development (7 mins)

Depending on the position you applied for, you will add X points to that area of the feature you are working on. The amount of points depends on your level, and whether you are getting a bonus from working on the same feature as the Project Lead.

Points increase the quality of a feature, until it reaches the max quality. Max quality is by default set to Good. This will allow you to achieve a 5/10 score if all your features hit this. To increase the max quality, you have to answer a Hard question correctly.

During development, you will randomly get asked a question to do with video games. If you answer it correctly, you will get a bonus or reward. Otherwise you will suffer a debuff, such as reducing the max quality of the feature you are working on.

### Review Score & Sales (2 mins)

Once a project has finished, the Review Score and Sales will be calculated.

Review Score will be sent to chat a minute after the project has finished. You'll get rewarded for having high quality features, as opposed to a high quantity of features. Any review score above 5 will grant the developers an XP bous.

Sales will be sent to the Project Lead two minutes after the project has finished. Sales are dependent on your review score, and the number of features.

### Commands

!project start **NAME** - Start a project called **NAME**.

!project start apply **POSITION** - Apply to join a project as either a **DESIGNER**, **DEVELOPER**, or **ARTIST**.

!project start accept **USERNAME** - Accept **USERNAME** onto the development team of your current project.

!project add feature **FEATURE NAME** - Add **FEATURE NAME** to your feature list.

!project move **FEATURE NAME** - Move to **FEATURE NAME**. Only the Project Lead can do this, and it gives a passive points bonus to anyone working on that feature.

!answer **ANSWER** - Choose an option between 1 and 4.
